# AI Workshop for Predictive Maintenance

## Agenda
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming a critical component of many engineering systems and disciplines today. In the field of predictive maintenance, AI is being used to design and develop smarter ways to perform anomaly detection, identify faults, and estimate remaining useful life of machines.  

In today’s hands-on workshop, you will write and execute code examples in MATLAB&reg; Online&trade; – entirely in the browser – to learn and explore how to apply principles of AI to predictive maintenance: machine learning, deep learning, feature extraction, and domain-specific data processing. 

This interactive hands-on session will include the following: 

* Familiarizing yourself with MATLAB Online and AI tools with an introductory example that trains a machine learning model to classify faults 
* Exploring how to extract features in the time and frequency domains, and rank them to obtain the most relevant features to train your AI model 
* Diving deep into an advanced, predictive maintenance workflow that covers anomaly detection and remaining useful life estimation 

MathWorks instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) will be available throughout the session to guide you. If the event is being held onsite, please bring your laptop and install the Google Chrome browser beforehand.
